  "quantum mechanics":
    "Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that provides a description of the physical properties of nature at the scale of atoms and subatomic particles. It is the foundation of all quantum physics including quantum chemistry, quantum field theory, quantum technology, and quantum information science.",
  "quantum computing":
    "Quantum computing is a type of computation that harnesses the collective properties of quantum states, such as superposition, interference, and entanglement, to perform calculations. The devices that perform quantum computations are known as quantum computers.",
  "quantum entanglement":
    "Quantum entanglement is a physical phenomenon that occurs when a pair or group of particles is generated, interact, or share spatial proximity in a way such that the quantum state of each particle of the pair or group cannot be described independently of the state of the others, including when the particles are separated by a large distance.",
  "schrödinger equation":
    "The Schrödinger equation is a linear partial differential equation that governs the wave function of a quantum-mechanical system. It is a key result in quantum mechanics, and its discovery was a significant landmark in the development of the subject.",
  "quantum field theory":
    "Quantum field theory is a theoretical framework that combines classical field theory, special relativity, and quantum mechanics. QFT is used in particle physics to construct physical models of subatomic particles and in condensed matter physics to construct models of quasiparticles.",
  "quantum gravity":
    "Quantum gravity is a field of theoretical physics that seeks to describe gravity according to the principles of quantum mechanics, and where quantum effects cannot be ignored, such as in the vicinity of black holes or similar compact astrophysical objects where the effects of gravity are strong.",
  "quantum tunneling":
    "Quantum tunneling is a quantum mechanical phenomenon where a subatomic particle passes through a potential barrier that it classically cannot surmount. This plays an essential role in several physical phenomena, such as the nuclear fusion that occurs in main sequence stars like the Sun.",
  "quantum superposition":
    "Quantum superposition is a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics that states that, much like waves in classical physics, any two (or more) quantum states can be added together ('superposed') and the result will be another valid quantum state; and conversely, that every quantum state can be represented as a sum of two or more other distinct states.",
  "heisenberg uncertainty principle":
    "The Heisenberg uncertainty principle is a fundamental principle in quantum mechanics that states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which complementary variables, such as position and momentum, can be known.",
  "quantum cryptography":
    "Quantum cryptography is the science of exploiting quantum mechanical properties to perform cryptographic tasks. The best known example of quantum cryptography is quantum key distribution which offers an information-theoretically secure solution to the key exchange problem.",

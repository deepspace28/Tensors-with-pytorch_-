1. **Quantum Superposition**: Particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured
2. **Quantum Entanglement**: Particles become connected and the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently
3. **Wave-Particle Duality**: Matter and light exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties

Quantum computing leverages these principles to perform calculations using quantum bits (qubits) that can represent multiple states simultaneously.`

1. **Special Relativity (1905)**: Describes the relationship between space and time, introducing concepts like:
   - The speed of light is constant for all observers
   - Time dilation and length contraction occur at speeds approaching the speed of light
   - Mass and energy are equivalent (E=mcÂ²)

2. **General Relativity (1915)**: Extends special relativity to include gravity:
   - Gravity is not a force but a curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy
   - Predicts phenomena like gravitational waves, black holes, and the bending of light around massive objects
   
These theories revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity, replacing Newton's theories for extreme conditions.`
